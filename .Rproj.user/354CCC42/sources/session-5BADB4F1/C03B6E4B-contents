Description: The goal of `ggfp` is to simplify the process of drawing 
    forest plots using ggplot2. We have packaged the main code 
    for drawing forest plots to form the `gg_fp()` function. 
    `gg_fp()` has the advantage that only a few parameters 
    need to be provided to draw a nice forest plot. Of course, 
    it also has the obvious disadvantage that some of the more 
    fine-grained graph adjustment parameters are not available 
    in `gg_fp()`.
